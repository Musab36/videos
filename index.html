    <h2>The Latest News</h2>

    <p>
    	North Korea says it has detained a US citizen on suspicion of "hostile acts" against the state.
Kim Hak-song worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) and was held on 6 May, state-run news agency KCNA said.
Three other US citizens are currently held in North Korea, including Kim Sang-duck, who had taught at PUST.
The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining its citizens to use them as pawns.
KCNA said that "a relevant institution" was "conducting [a] detailed investigation" into Kim Hak-song's alleged crimes.
It gave no further details.
A State Department official said Washington was "aware of reports that a US citizen was detained in North Korea", adding it would liaise with the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which helps look after US interests in North Korea.
Kim Hak-song had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at PUST, Reuters news agency reported, citing an online post by Mr Kim.
Inside North Korea's Western-funded university
PUST is a university that mostly teaches the children of North Korea's elite.
It was founded in 2010 by a Korean-American Christian entrepreneur, with much of the costs funded by US and South Korea Christian charities.
Several foreign lecturers are thought to teach at the university.

<h2>Meanwhile in Germany</h2>

    	Inspections have been ordered at every German army barracks, after Nazi-era memorabilia was found at two of them.
The defence ministry said the command came from the inspector general of the Bundeswehr (Germany's armed forces).
All barracks will be searched for material linked to the Wehrmacht, the army which served Adolf Hitler.
The move follows a growing scandal over far-right extremism within the army, with an officer accused of plotting an attack disguised as a Syrian refugee.
The army lieutenant, who had expressed far-right views, was arrested in late April.
Prosecutors in Frankfurt said the 28-year-old suspect had a "xenophobic background".
Germany's Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen cancelled a planned trip to the US and travelled to his garrison in Illkirch, northeastern France.
Officials found Wehrmacht memorabilia openly displayed there in the common room, despite a ban on Nazi symbols.
German defence minister attacks own army
A second barracks, FÃ¼rstenberg in Donaueschingen, southwest Germany, was then sucked into the scandal on Saturday after a display cabinet was found containing Nazi-era helmets.
Spiegel online reported that pictures of Wehrmacht soldiers were found on a wall, along with Nazi pistols, more helmets and military decorations.

    <h2>Stupid terrorists killing innocents!!!</h2>
    <img src="img/talib.jpg">
    <p>
    	More than 2,000 families have been forced to flee their homes in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz amid heavy fighting, officials say.
The evacuations came as Taliban militants seized the district of Qala-e-Zal, just west of the city.
Clashes continue in other parts of the city, as the Taliban try to increase pressure on government troops in both the north and south of the country.
The militants twice entered Kunduz in the past two years before retreating.
BBC South Asia editor Jill McGivering says this is a classic example of surge and retreat which is now common in Afghanistan as the Taliban tries to extend its reach but struggles to retain new ground.
The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said in a statement that while some fleeing families were able to find refuge with relatives others were forced to sleep in the open.
Who are the Taliban?
Afghanistan's new 'Great Game'
"Those with no money, like widows, are in Qala-e Zal desert, as they couldn't make it as far as the city. They are now living in the open," local resident Abdul Karim told the NRC.
A recent US report suggests more than 600,000 Afghans were displaced by fighting last year, a 40% increase on the previous year.
There has been increased fighting in northern Afghanistan since the Taliban announced their Spring offensive on 28 April.
